# Universal Annotation of Biological Sequences using Large Language Models

Master Thesis by Johanne Badsberg Overgaard

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and analyses for my master's thesis project focused on developing a new universal approach for protein sequence annotation. The goal was to explore how raw attention weights from the ESM-2 language model can be used to extract biologically relevant regions annotated by clustering the regions based on their ESM-2 embeddings. This approach aims to enhance our understanding of protein function through refinement of already annotated sequences and annotation of novel sequences. 

The project has been supervised by Associate Professor Kristoffer Vitting-Seerup, Group leader of The Isoform Analysis Group at the Department of Health Technology, Technical University of Denmark.
